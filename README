Kerava

Synth, music, additional direction:                              collateralburger
Ukko model and character animation, Kerava landmark buildings:   Warma
Everything else:                                                 Trilkk

This work intends to celebrate Kerava's rich history, culture and architecture. We hope
it makes even one person visit this prominent and beautiful city.

Insofar as I know, this is the first ever 'fully' compressed Linux-arm32l intro in the
sense it skips the GNU linker completely. The amount of hoops necessary to be jumped to
achieve this is significantly higher than with traditional ia32/amd64 architecture.
Full explanation would be too long for this text file.

Real wild technically has no size restrictions, but this work ended up being 75k in
size, so it would fit into 80k category. Ports for other platforms are found in rel/,
but they follow no size restrictions whatsoever. If you want to run the program
yourself, starting in developer mode (-d or --developer) will skip synthesizing the
music and instead load the .flac file which is a lot faster. In this case you need to
press 'p' to start.

Greets in the intro.
